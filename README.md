So, you've stumbled upon my little dungeon in the depths of GitHub where I'm documenting my wild and wacky adventures in Pythonland.

## What's This Repo About?

Glad you asked! This repo is basically my digital diary of learning Python. 
From the "Hello, World!" beginnings to more complex projects as I gradually unravel the mysteries of coding.

## Warning: May Contain Obnoxious And Revolting Errors

Trigger warning: my code might make your eyes twitch, your brain hurt, and you question your life choices. 
But you know what - I don't care.
